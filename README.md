## Handwritten Digit Predictor

### Introduction:
Handwritten digit recognition is a crucial application in various industries, including banking, healthcare, and education. This project explores the effectiveness of CNNs in predicting handwritten digits.

### Methodology:
1. Data Collection: MNIST dataset (70,000 images)
2. Data Preprocessing: Reshaping, normalization and one-hot encoding
3. Model Architecture: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
4. Training: Adam optimizer, categorical-cross-entropy loss, and accuracy metrics
5. Testing: Accuracy evaluation and confusion matrix analysis

### Model Architecture:
1. Conv2D layers (16, 8 filters)
2. Max Pooling layers (2x2)
3. Flatten layer
4. Dense layers (100, 10 units)
5. Output layer (softmax activation)

### Real-World Applications:
Handwritten digit prediction applications have numerous real-world applications, solving problems across various industries =>
1. Automated Data Entry: Extracting handwritten digits from forms, surveys, and documents, reducing manual data entry errors.
2. Check Processing: Reading handwritten numerical values on checks, streamlining banking transactions.
3. Mail Sorting: Recognizing handwritten zip codes and addresses, improving mail delivery efficiency.
4. Healthcare: Analyzing handwritten medical records, prescriptions, and patient data.
5. Elections: Verifying handwritten voter information and ballot counts.
6. Education: Grading handwritten multiple-choice exams and assessments.
7. Financial Document Analysis: Reading handwritten numbers on invoices, receipts, and financial statements.
8. Historical Document Digitization: Converting handwritten historical documents into digital formats.
9. Accessibility: Helping individuals with disabilities by recognizing handwritten text.
